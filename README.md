Click "launch binder" above to launch the exercises in Binder, a read-only environment for Jupyter Notebooks. This means that your progress will be erased when the browser tab is closed. Please download the notebook files you wish to keep: right-click on the file and click "Download".

Content of this course is largely adapted from [Sololearn's Python Core](https://www.sololearn.com/learning/1073) course. However, exercises, discussions and assignments in the notebooks are mostly made by me.
